%% Evaluate state %%
% Function to compute the acceleration vector norm from cylindrical coordinates

% Inputs: - array P, the set of control points to estimate the position vector 
%         - array B, the polynomial basis in use in the approximation
%         - vector n, with the degrees of approximation of each position
%           coordinate

% Outputs: - array C, the 9xm state vector 

function [C] = evaluate_state(P, B, n)
    % Extract the spacecraft coodinates evaluating the BÃ©zier curve approximation
    N = size(P,1);                   % Number of state variables
    C = zeros(N,size(B{1},2));       % Preallocation for speed

    for i = 1:size(P,1)
        % State vector fitting
        C(i,:) = P(i,1:n(i)+1)*B{i};
    end
